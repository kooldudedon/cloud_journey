# cloud_journey
Hello,   

Welcome to the written account of my Cloud Engineering / DevOps journey!  In this project you will find resources associated with my journey, as well as projects and key-take-aways along my Cloud journey.

Before we get rolling ahead in this journey it is important to note my starting point. November 2021 marked the start of my Cisco Certified Network Associate journey, and April 2022 marked my completion of that journey.  In my opinion, CCNA introduced and prepared me to take on the Cloud Engineering journey.  I recommend starting there if someone is new to Information Technology.  For more information, please go to Cisco's website: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html?msclkid=364e6452d08311ecb05419561a5edd1a#~about-ccna.  

Below are some of the key resources that aided learning and development during my CCNA journey:
1) Official Cert Guide CCNA 200-301
2) Pearson CCNA Simulator
3) Neil Anderson's Udemy course: The Complete Guide to Getting Certified
4) David Bombal's Udemy course: CCNA Packet Tracer Ultimate Labs
5) Jeremy IT Lab
6) Boson Ex-Sim

Networking is central to everything we do on the internetwork (internet).  Therefore, it was a no brainer to start my Cloud journey by learning as much as I could about the basics of Networking.  After acheiving my CCNA and building my personal home lab, it was time to go a bit deeper.  Typically in the networking world going deeper means one of two things: acheiving a higher-level certification or learning Linux.  Linux again was a no-brainer since Cloud computing was my ultimate end goal.
