Before we get rolling ahead in this journey it is important to note my starting point. November 2021 marked the start of my Cisco Certified Network Associate journey, and April 2022 marked my completion of that journey.  In my opinion, CCNA introduced and prepared me to take on the Cloud Engineering journey.  I recommend starting there if someone is new to Information Technology.
